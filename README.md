Node Queue
==========

This module allows people to arbitrarily place nodes into an ordered list for
any purpose.

Examples of usage can include:
* To create a managed list of posts that appear on the home page.
* To create a sidebar block with a bullet list of 5 selected posts.
* To create sub-set of posts, from which one can be selected at random.
* To highlight one particular node, as in a typical news site's Lead Article.
